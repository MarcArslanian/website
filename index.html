            9/18/23 - We had to fix some minor problems with a bunch of tapes for our rude Goldberg machine. I saved the group with the idea of a car and brought the batmobile, in our machine we used a wheel and axle, an inclined plane, and a lever

        10/4/2023 -, David, Brooklyn and I built a prosthetic hand using cardboard tape and rope. we cut a  hand out of cardboard, poked holes in the knuckles, tied the rope through the holes, taped the rope together, and put tape on the fingers as extra grip.

        10/20/23 -,  Kevin, Valentine, and I built a bottle rocket this week. Putting three cardboard fins near the bottle's side and cap and a paper cone at the bottom wich was a  easy design. When we launched the rocket it fell apart mid air but after that I had the idea f just using the bottle with nothing on it and it went one for eh furthest

        10/25/23 -This week, me, tony, and Brooklyn made a water filter . We used, rocks, pebbles, sand, and cotton balls to turn the dirty water into lean water. On the first try, we packed 10 cotton balls down, rocks, pebbles, sand. we kept doing this  three times before there was no difference. After it got stuck we made a second filter and change the order of the materials. We switched rock and sand, but the filter did not work as good as the first one but after that failure we put in less sand and when the water came out it was clear
