        10/4/2023 -, David, Brooklyn and I built a prosthetic hand using cardboard tape and rope. we cut a  hand out of cardboard, poked holes in the knuckles, tied the rope through the holes, taped the rope together, and put tape on the fingers as extra grip.

        10/20/23 -,  Kevin, Valentine, and I built a bottle rocket this week. Putting three cardboard fins near the bottle's side and cap and a paper cone at the bottom wich was a  easy design. When we launched the rocket it fell apart mid air but after that I had the idea f just using the bottle with nothing on it and it went one for eh furthest

        10/25/23 -This week, me, tony, and Brooklyn made a water filter . We used, rocks, pebbles, sand, and cotton balls to turn the dirty water into lean water. On the first try, we packed 10 cotton balls down, rocks, pebbles, sand. we kept doing this  three times before there was no difference. After it got stuck we made a second filter and change the order of the materials. We switched rock and sand, but the filter did not work as good as the first one but after that failure we put in less sand and when the water came out it was clear

        2/14 tony and i finsihsed building our car today and oit goes really far. i used 1 feet of rope tied arounf the back axle of the car. Our car is very inconsestint, one time it wen 9 feet another 17 and the furthest so far is 22 feet. we used a 8 inches foot rod and a 1 foor axle. using the equation  the prediction was 120 inchs or 10 feet but we exeeded the equation and went 22 feet

          2/28 - I, Tony, and Valentin built our second iteration of the car. it was bigger and had a longer rod but in the end, it did not move at all becasue it was too big and heavy to move. we took the rod and put it on the first iteration of the car, the rod was much longer than the car by 5 inches probably I don't remember. the second iteration is basically the first but with a longer rod that was 15 inches compared to the old 6-inch one. it went 37.3 feet compared to our old measly 22 feet.

        3/4 - i started off working with vaentin and tony about the eggdrop but thankfully mr. kim sai i can work alone. i came up with a triangle base with chec ckered holes. the traingle wich is hollow catches the wind and slows down the egg andn the checkered base help maintain a precise anount of air so it dosent flip. aroiund the triangle i will make a ball so when it touches the ground it rolls around and disperses its enrgy in the role. i will keep the ballons in the traingle to coushin the egg instead of using them to sloww the fall since i have the traingle.the ball will have 2 layers and bewteen the layers there will be some cotton.

        3/8 - i finsihed my eggdrop today with the idea of putting my egg in a balloon but it dident fit. i just put the egg in the top part of the pyramid and stuffed it with cotten. I dropped my prohect and the egg cracked, it wasent the structure it was that the egg fell out of the build and died. the seond iteration i put a floor to the pyramid and made sure the egg stays in place and survives. in the end when i droped my second atempt it survived and i was crowned the egg king.
